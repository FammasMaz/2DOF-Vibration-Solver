# 2DOF-Vibration-Solver
This small piece of code can solve vibration problems for a 2DOF system, given that it is undamped

## Inputs:

- Stiffness Values of the Springs or Shafts or whatever
- Mass or Torsional Inertia Values of the Disks/Blocks, all that shebang

## Outputs:

- Natural Frequencies of the System
- Mode Shape Vecotors in Normalized Form
- Eigen Vectors in Normalized Form
- Check Built-In for Checking the Orthogonality of the System

### interim.m script can solve using the eigen values and vectors method. The other method is still wip and is not recommended to be used.
